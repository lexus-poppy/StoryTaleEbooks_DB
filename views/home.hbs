    <p>Storytale eBooks sells $ 5 million digital books annually. To track the sales and utilization of digital books,</p>
    <p>the database records the relationship between coupons and orders. Each order can utilize exactly one coupon. There </p>
    <p>can be multiple books per order. The current management system for Storytale eBooks is insufficient for the scale of </p>
    <p>its annual sales and transaction volume. A back-end database with their website would improve the reliability of </p>
    <p>day-to-day operations. The database is in 3NF. </p>
